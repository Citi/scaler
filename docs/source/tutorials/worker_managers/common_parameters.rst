Common Worker Manager Parameters
================================

All worker managers in Scaler share a set of common configuration parameters. Not every worker manager supports every parameter — specific docs note any differences.

.. note::
    For more details on Scaler configuration, see :doc:`../commands`.

Networking
----------

* ``scheduler_address`` (positional, required): The address of the scheduler (e.g., ``tcp://127.0.0.1:8516``).
* ``--worker-scheduler-address`` (``-wsa``): Scheduler address used by spawned workers. If omitted, it defaults to ``scheduler_address``.
* ``--worker-manager-id`` (``-wmi``, required): A stable identifier for this worker manager instance. Must be unique across all managers connected to the same scheduler. The scheduler uses this ID to associate workers with their manager and to detect duplicate connections.
* ``--max-task-concurrency`` (``-mtc``): Maximum total number of workers that can be active across all spawned instances or containers (default: number of CPUs). Set to ``-1`` for no limit. For worker managers that spawn multi-worker machines (e.g. ORB AWS EC2, AWS Raw ECS), the number of instances spawned is ``ceil(max_task_concurrency / workers_per_instance)``, so the actual worker count may exceed ``max_task_concurrency`` by up to ``workers_per_instance - 1`` due to rounding up to the nearest whole instance.

  **Example** — ``--max-task-concurrency 10`` with an EC2 instance type that has 4 vCPUs (e.g. ``c5.xlarge``):

  .. math::

      \lceil 10 / 4 \rceil = 3 \text{ instances} \times 4 \text{ workers} = 12 \text{ workers active}

  The ceiling ensures enough instances are launched to reach at least 10 workers, at the cost of up to 3 extra workers (``4 - 1``).
* ``--object-storage-address`` (``-osa``): Optional object storage server address override (e.g., ``tcp://127.0.0.1:8517``). If omitted, workers use the address advertised by scheduler heartbeats.
* ``--config`` (``-c``): Path to a TOML configuration file.

Nesting
-------

A cloud worker manager runs a native worker manager in each resource it provisions. That child takes its desired task concurrency from its parent instead of the scheduler.

* ``--children-address`` (``-ca``): Address the worker manager binds for its units to dial. Local worker processes default to a free loopback port. ORB AWS EC2, AWS Raw ECS, and OCI Raw require it: each provisioned resource runs a native worker manager that dials this address, so it must be reachable from those resources.
* ``--advertised-children-address`` (``-aca``): Address the units dial, written into their start command. Defaults to ``--children-address``. Set it when the units reach the worker manager through NAT, such as an EC2 public IP that is not on any local interface.
* ``--parent-address`` (``-pa``) and ``--unit-id``: Set by a cloud worker manager in the command that starts its child. The child takes its desired task concurrency from this parent instead of the scheduler.

Worker Behavior
---------------

These parameters control individual worker processes started by the worker manager.

* ``--per-worker-task-queue-size`` (``-wtqs``): Task queue size per worker (default: ``1000``).
* ``--heartbeat-interval-seconds`` (``-his``): Interval at which workers send heartbeats to the scheduler in seconds (default: ``2``).
* ``--task-timeout-seconds`` (``-tts``): Seconds before a task is considered timed out. ``0`` means no timeout (default: ``0``).
* ``--death-timeout-seconds`` (``-dts``): Seconds before a worker is considered dead if no heartbeat is received (default: ``300``).
* ``--garbage-collect-interval-seconds`` (``-gc``): Interval at which the worker runs garbage collection in seconds (default: ``30``).
* ``--trim-memory-threshold-bytes`` (``-tm``): Threshold for trimming libc's memory in bytes (default: ``1073741824``, i.e., 1 GB).
* ``--hard-processor-suspend`` (``-hps``): When set, suspends worker processors using SIGTSTP instead of a synchronization event.
* ``--io-threads`` (``-it``): Number of IO threads per worker (default: ``1``).
* ``--per-worker-capabilities`` (``-pwc``): Comma-separated list of capabilities (e.g., ``"linux,cpu=4"``).
  Each entry is either a bare capability name (e.g., ``linux``, meaning unlimited) or ``name=integer`` (e.g., ``cpu=4``).
  Capability names must not be empty strings: entries like ``=1`` or a value without an integer after ``=``
  (e.g., ``cpu=``) are rejected.

Logging and Event Loop
----------------------

* ``--event-loop`` (``-el``): Event loop type: ``builtin`` or ``uvloop`` (default: ``builtin``).
* ``--logging-level`` (``-ll``): Logging level: ``DEBUG``, ``INFO``, ``WARNING``, ``ERROR``, ``CRITICAL`` (default: ``WARNING``).
* ``--logging-paths`` (``-lp``): Paths where logs are written. Defaults to ``/dev/stdout``. Multiple paths can be specified.
* ``--logging-config-file`` (``-lcf``): Path to a Python logging configuration file (``.conf`` format).
