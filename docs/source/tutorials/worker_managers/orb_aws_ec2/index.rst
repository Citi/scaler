Open Resource Broker AWS EC2 Worker Manager
===========================================

Use this worker manager to provision Scaler workers dynamically on AWS EC2 via
ORB (Open Resource Broker).

Quickstart Guides
-----------------

Two quickstart setups are available depending on your environment:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   quickstart_ec2
   quickstart_nat

:doc:`Quickstart (EC2) <quickstart_ec2>` is recommended for most users. It runs
all services on a fresh EC2 instance, so workers can connect via private VPC
addresses — no NAT or port-forwarding required.

:doc:`Quickstart (NAT) <quickstart_nat>` runs the scheduler and worker manager
on your local machine and forwards traffic from a public IP to reach AWS workers.
Use this if you need to keep the scheduler on a machine you already manage.

Requirements
------------

Before using the ORB AWS EC2 worker manager, make sure:

* You have an AWS account.
* Python is installed on the machine that runs the worker manager.
* The scheduler host can be reached from provisioned AWS workers. If your scheduler is behind a firewall/private network, set up NAT so workers can connect back to the scheduler.

AWS Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: AWS Root account

      The AWS root account does not require additional IAM policy grants for this setup.

   .. group-tab:: IAM User

      If you are not using the root account, attach the ``SignInLocalDevelopmentAccess``
      AWS managed policy to your IAM user so that ``aws login`` (SSO) works:

      .. code-block:: bash

         aws iam attach-user-policy \
           --user-name <YOUR_USER> \
           --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/SignInLocalDevelopmentAccess

      Then create and attach the EC2 provisioning policy. Before running
      the commands below, prepare these values:

      * IAM user name (for ``--user-name``)
      * AWS account ID (for policy ARN)
      * IAM role name, if attaching the same policy to a role

      Then create the policy and attach it to an IAM user/role:

      .. code-block:: bash

         aws iam create-policy \
           --policy-name ScalerORBWorkerManagerPolicy \
           --policy-document '{

      Attach to an IAM user:

      .. code-block:: bash

         aws iam attach-user-policy \
           --user-name <YOUR_USER> \
           --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:policy/ScalerORBWorkerManagerPolicy

      Attach to an IAM role:

      .. code-block:: bash

         aws iam attach-role-policy \
           --role-name <YOUR_ROLE> \
           --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:policy/ScalerORBWorkerManagerPolicy

      Spot Fleet service-linked role (once per account, only if using Spot Fleet):

      .. code-block:: bash

         aws iam create-service-linked-role --aws-service-name spotfleet.amazonaws.com

      Get your account ID:

      .. code-block:: bash

         aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text

Worker Image Customization Modes
---------------------------------

The worker manager supports two mutually exclusive worker-image modes. Choose exactly one:

* Use an existing pre-built AMI.
* Use a base image and install Python/packages when instances start.

**Base Image + Startup Install**

Provide both ``--python-version`` and ``--requirements-txt`` (both required). Instances use the
base Amazon Linux 2023 (AL2023) image, then install the specified Python version and dependencies
at startup. ``opengris-scaler`` must be included in ``requirements_txt``.

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: config.toml

      .. code-block:: toml

             --python-version 3.14 \
             --requirements-txt "opengris-scaler>=1.26.6"

**Existing Pre-built AMI**

Provide ``--image-id``. The specified AMI is used as-is and must already include
``opengris-scaler`` with ``scaler_worker_manager`` available on ``PATH``.

This mode is recommended for production deployments where startup latency matters or where the
worker environment must be tightly controlled.

Networking Configuration
------------------------

Workers launched by the ORB AWS EC2 manager are EC2 instances and require an externally-reachable IP address for the scheduler.

*   **Internal Communication**: If the machine running the scheduler is another EC2 instance in the same VPC, you can use EC2 private IP addresses.
*   **Public Internet**: If communicating over the public internet, it is highly recommended to set up robust security rules and/or a VPN to protect the cluster.

Supported Parameters
--------------------

.. note::
    For more details on how to configure Scaler, see the :doc:`../../commands` section.

The ORB AWS EC2 worker manager supports ORB-specific configuration parameters as well as common worker manager parameters.

ORB AWS EC2 Template Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*   ``--image-id``: AMI ID for the worker instances. Mutually exclusive with ``--python-version`` and
    ``--requirements-txt``. When provided, the latest AL2023 AMI is not used and no packages are installed.
*   ``--python-version``: Python version to install on each worker instance (e.g. ``3.14``). Required when
    ``--image-id`` is not specified.
*   ``--requirements-txt``: Requirements to install on each worker instance. Can be a path to a local
    ``requirements.txt`` file or a string literal. The content is embedded in the EC2 user data script and
    installed via ``pip install -r``. ``opengris-scaler`` must be included. Required when ``--image-id`` is
    not specified.
*   ``--instance-type``: EC2 instance type (default: ``t2.micro``).
*   ``--aws-region``: AWS region where ORB launches worker instances (required).
*   ``--key-name``: AWS key pair name for the instances. If not provided, a temporary key pair will be created and deleted on cleanup.
*   ``--subnet-id``: AWS subnet ID where the instances will be launched. If not provided, it attempts to discover the default subnet in the default VPC.
*   ``--security-group-ids``: Comma-separated list of AWS security group IDs. They must allow each instance to reach the scheduler and ``--children-address``.
*   ``--children-address`` (required): Address this worker manager binds for the native worker manager on each instance to dial. Must be reachable from the instances.

Common Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a full list of common parameters including networking (``--worker-manager-id``, ``--max-task-concurrency``, ``--object-storage-address``, etc.), worker configuration, and logging, see :doc:`../common_parameters`.

.. note::
    For the ORB AWS EC2 manager, ``--max-task-concurrency`` is the total number of workers, not the number of instances. Each EC2 instance runs one worker per vCPU, so the number of instances launched is ``ceil(max_task_concurrency / vcpus_per_instance)``. The vCPU count is retrieved automatically from the AWS EC2 API for the configured ``--instance-type``.

    **Example** — ``--max-task-concurrency 10`` with ``--instance-type c5.xlarge`` (4 vCPUs): ``ceil(10 / 4) = 3`` instances are launched. The first two run 4 workers each and the last runs 2, so 10 workers are active.

Cleanup
-------

The ORB AWS EC2 worker manager is designed to be self-cleaning, but it is important to be aware of the resources it manages:

*   **Key Pairs**: If a ``--key-name`` is not provided, the manager creates a temporary AWS key pair.
*   **Security Groups**: If ``--security-group-ids`` are not provided, the manager creates a temporary security group to allow communication.
*   **Launch Templates**: ORB may additionally create EC2 Launch Templates as part of the machine provisioning process.

The manager attempts to delete these temporary resources and terminate all launched EC2 instances when it shuts down gracefully. However, in the event of an ungraceful crash or network failure, some resources may persist in your AWS account.

.. tip::
    It is recommended to periodically check your AWS console for any orphaned resources (instances, security groups, key pairs, or launch templates) and clean them up manually if necessary to avoid unexpected costs.
