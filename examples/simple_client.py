"""
This example demonstrates the most basic implementation to work with scaler
Scaler applications have three parts - scheduler, cluster, and client.
Scheduler is used to schedule works send from client to cluster.
Cluster, composed of 1 or more worker(s), are used to execute works.
Client is used to send tasks to scheduler.

This example shows a client sends 100 tasks, where each task represents the
execution of math.sqrt function and get back the results.

    # Instantiate a Client that represents a client aforementioned. One may submit task using client.
    # Since client is sending task(s) to the scheduler, we need to know the address that the scheduler has. In this
